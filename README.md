# OLA Ride Performance Analysis | SQL + Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes ride-hailing data to evaluate booking performance, revenue generation, cancellation behavior, and customer usage patterns.

Using SQL, key business queries were performed to extract insights such as successful bookings, ride distance trends, cancellation counts, and top customers. These insights were then visualized in Power BI through an interactive dashboard to monitor ride efficiency, revenue distribution, and operational performance.

---

## Business Context

Ride-hailing operations depend heavily on ride completion rates, cancellation behavior, and customer demand patterns, all of which directly impact revenue and service efficiency.

This analysis focuses on:

- Monitoring successful vs cancelled rides to understand operational efficiency

- Identifying cancellation patterns from both customers and drivers

- Analyzing revenue contribution across vehicle types and payment methods

- Evaluating customer behavior and ride frequencye

---

## Business Objectives

- Analyze total bookings and successful ride rate

- Evaluate revenue performance (booking value trends)

- Identify cancellation patterns by customers and drivers

- Measure average ride distance and customer ratings

- Identify top customers based on ride frequency

- Understand payment method contribution to revenue

COUNT(ride_data[Booking_ID])


**Successful Rides** = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(ride_data[Booking_ID]),
    ride_data[Booking_Status] = "Success"
)


**Successful Ride Rate** = 
DIVIDE(
    [Successful Rides],
    [Total Rides]
)


**Successful Booking Value** = 
CALCULATE(

## Business Questions

- What percentage of total bookings are successfully completed, and how efficient is the ride fulfillment process?

- How much revenue is generated from completed rides, and how does it trend over time?

- Which payment methods contribute the most to total revenue, and is there over-dependence on specific modes?

- Which vehicle types generate the highest revenue, and how does their performance compare in terms of ride volume?

- Who are the top customers contributing to ride frequency, and how concentrated is the demand?

- What is the average ride distance, and what does it indicate about customer travel patterns?

- What is the overall customer satisfaction level based on ratings, and does it indicate stable service quality?


---

## Key Insights


- The ride success rate is **~62%**, meaning nearly **38% of bookings do not convert into completed rides**, indicating a significant gap in operational efficiency.

- Total revenue stands at **~39.03M**, but this reflects only completed rides, suggesting that a substantial portion of potential revenue is lost due to unsuccessful bookings.

- Revenue is heavily concentrated in **Cash and UPI payments**, indicating a strong dependency on these methods and low diversification in payment channels.

- Certain vehicle types generate **higher revenue with comparable ride volumes**, highlighting differences in pricing and customer preference across categories.

- A small group of customers appears repeatedly in the top bookings, suggesting **customer concentration**, where a limited segment drives a significant share of demand.

- The average ride distance of **~14.21 km** indicates a balanced mix of short and medium-distance trips, reflecting typical urban mobility patterns.

- Customer ratings average around **4.0**, indicating stable but not exceptional service quality, leaving room for improvement in customer experience.


---

## Business Recommendations

- **Improve ride completion rate:**  
  Focus on reducing the ~38% failure rate by optimizing driver allocation and minimizing delays in ride acceptance.

- **Reduce revenue leakage:**  
  Convert more bookings into successful rides by addressing cancellation causes identified in SQL analysis.

- **Diversify payment methods:**  
  Promote card and wallet usage through targeted incentives to reduce over-dependence on cash and UPI.

- **Optimize vehicle supply strategy:**  
  Increase availability of high-performing vehicle types that generate higher revenue to maximize earnings.

- **Strengthen customer retention:**  
  Introduce loyalty programs for high-frequency users who contribute significantly to booking volume.

- **Enhance long-distance ride incentives:**  
  Provide driver incentives for longer trips to ensure availability and reduce cancellation probability for high-value rides.

- **Enhance customer experience:**  
  Improve service quality to push ratings beyond 4.0 by reducing wait times and ensuring ride reliability.
